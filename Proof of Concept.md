# Proof of Concept: Price Test Easy Tool

**Development Status**: âœ… Completed MVP + Advanced Features  
**Demo Link**: https://price-test-smalltool.vercel.app/

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

âœ… **COMPLETED**: Built an advanced interactive Price A/B Testing simulation tool that:
- Visualizes how different pricing strategies affect conversion rate, revenue, and profit
- Supports both manual parameter input and CSV product upload with actual business data
- Uses actual conversion rates as baseline for realistic price elasticity modeling
- Features real-time optimal pricing recommendations based on selected criteria
- Provides comprehensive cost modeling (COGS, shipping fees, transaction fees)
- Demonstrates the value of A/B testing through educational content

The tool successfully helps merchants gain intuitive insights into pricing impactâ€”driving interest and traffic to ABConvert's A/B testing product.

## âœ… Problem Solved

**Original Problem**: Most merchants lack an intuitive grasp of how pricing influences customer behavior and revenue.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- **Dual-Mode Interface**: Manual input for theoretical scenarios + CSV upload for real product data
- **Realistic Modeling**: Uses actual conversion rates as baseline with price elasticity calculations
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Shows conversion rate, revenue, profit, and optimal pricing
- **Educational Journey**: Clear explanation of why simulation â‰  reality and A/B testing value
- **Professional UX**: Clean, responsive interface with interactive sliders and real-time updates

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Next.js 15** with App Router and TypeScript
- **React 19** with client-side state management
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for responsive styling
- **Recharts** for interactive data visualization
- **Papa Parse** for CSV file processing

### Mathematical Foundation

**Price Elasticity Model**:
```typescript
// Uses actual conversion rate as baseline
const baseConversionRate = actualConversionRate / 100;

// Calculate price elasticity using WTP distribution
const elasticityMultiplier = normCDF(Î¼ - newPrice, 0, Ïƒ) / normCDF(Î¼ - originalPrice, 0, Ïƒ);

// Predict conversion rate at new price
const newConversionRate = baseConversionRate Ã— elasticityMultiplier;
```

**Cost Structure**:
```typescript
const totalCost = COGS + shippingFee + (price Ã— transactionFeePercent / 100);
const profit = (price - totalCost) Ã— traffic Ã— conversionRate;
```
